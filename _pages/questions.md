My research directions are guided by certain questions I'm interested in answering or elucidating. Here is a list of some of them:

## Computational Membrane Biology

1. Can transcriptomic profiling predict the nanoscale proteomic organization of the cell's plasma membrane and/or organelle membranes? And how should lipidologic information be factored into the prediction model?

2. To what extent do the nanoscale organizations of cell/organelle membranes differ across healthy / diseased individuals for a given disease? And can we utilize this for more granular disease subtyping / disease progression modeling? E.g. for type 2 diabetes subtyping / progression.

3. Can nanoscale organization of cell/organelle membranes be used as a (functional) biomarker of aging? Is there a "membrane clock"?

4. How can the next generation of targeted drug delivery vehicles take into account the membranes' nanoscale organization?
