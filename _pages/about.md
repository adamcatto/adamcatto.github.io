I am a data scientist / scientific programmer in the Neuroscience Department at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. I work on machine learning / AI for medical imaging, molecular neurobiology, and automation of neuroscience experiments.

Previously I was a master's student in the CUNY Graduate Center's Department of Computer Science, I worked as a graduate research assistant in the [Hunter College Distributed AI Lab](https://anraja.commons.gc.cuny.edu/research-distributed-artificial-intelligence-research-dair-lab/), under the supervision of Professor Anita Raja, where I developed machine learning and data mining methods for clinical applications, with a focus on AI for sequential decision-making and machine learning tasks involving large amounts of missing data. 

During my time at CUNY, I also worked as a research data scientist intern at the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, where I developed machine learning and signal processing pipelines to identify digital biomarkers of sleep and activity in immunological disease populations via wearable activity monitors.

As an undergraduate at Stony Brook University, I majored in applied math & statistics and philosophy, with research focuses on formal methods in metaphilosophy, philosophy of physics, and mathematical logic. My undergraduate research in philosophy was supervised by [Professor Gary Mar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_R._Mar).

Doing academic research requires one to constantly learn about new techniques, basic discoveries, and viewpoints that have been published in journals, conference proceedings, and preprint servers. In addition to this, I try to incorporate systematic self-directed learning of topics in math, engineering, and biology/medicine into my schedule. As part of my training in biomedical science and informatics, I am currently studying molecular and cell biology and biochemistry from the classic textbooks [Molecular Biology of the Cell](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/) and [Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/product/Lehninger-Principles-of-Biochemistry/p/1319228003). I've previously independently studied topics such as digital signal processing, [exposomics](https://www.amazon.com/Exposome-Primer-Gary-W-Miller/dp/0124172172), [category theory](http://englishonlineclub.com/pdf/Category%20Teory%20[EnglishOnlineClub.com].pdf), and [reinforcement learning](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html). I'm excited to dive deeper into membrane structural biology, cell signaling, [robust statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics) ([book](https://www.amazon.com/Robust-Statistics-Peter-J-Huber/dp/0470129905)), and a wide array of bioinformatics techniques.
