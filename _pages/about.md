# About Me

## Professional

---

I'm currently a master's student in the CUNY Graduate Center's Department of Computer Science, with research interests in computational biology, biomedical informatics, and personalized medicine. I work as a graduate research assistant in the [Hunter College Distributed AI Lab](https://anraja.commons.gc.cuny.edu/research-distributed-artificial-intelligence-research-dair-lab/), under the supervision of Professor Anita Raja, where I am developing machine learning and data mining methods for clinical applications, with a focus on AI for sequential decision-making and machine learning tasks involving large amounts of missing data. Previously I worked as a research data scientist intern at the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, where I worked on machine learning and signal processing methods for identifying digital biomarkers of sleep and activity in immunological disease populations via wearable activity monitors.

As an undergraduate at Stony Brook University, I majored in applied math & statistics and philosophy, with research focuses on formal methods in philosophy and mathematical logic. My undergraduate research in philosophy was supervised by [Professor Gary Mar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_R._Mar).

Doing academic research requires one to constantly learn about new techniques, basic discoveries, and viewpoints that have been published in journals, conference proceedings, and preprint servers. In addition to this, I try to incorporate systematic self-directed learning of topics in math, engineering, and biology/medicine into my schedule. As part of my training in biomedical science and informatics, I am currently studying molecular and cell biology and biochemistry from the classic textbooks [Molecular Biology of the Cell](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/) and [Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/product/Lehninger-Principles-of-Biochemistry/p/1319228003). I've previously independently studied topics such as digital signal processing, [exposomics](https://www.amazon.com/Exposome-Primer-Gary-W-Miller/dp/0124172172), [category theory](http://englishonlineclub.com/pdf/Category%20Teory%20[EnglishOnlineClub.com].pdf), and [reinforcement learning](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html). I'm excited to dive deeper into membrane structural biology, cell signaling, [robust statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics) ([book](https://www.amazon.com/Robust-Statistics-Peter-J-Huber/dp/0470129905)), and a wide array of bioinformatics techniques.
