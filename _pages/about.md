## Current

I am a data scientist / scientific programmer in the Neuroscience Department at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. I work on machine learning, AI, and high-performance scientific computing for medical imaging, molecular neurobiology, and automation of neuroscience experiments.

## Previous

Previously I was a master's student in the CUNY Graduate Center's Department of Computer Science, I worked as a graduate research assistant in the [Hunter College Distributed AI Lab](https://anraja.commons.gc.cuny.edu/research-distributed-artificial-intelligence-research-dair-lab/), under the supervision of Professor Anita Raja, where I developed machine learning and data mining methods for clinical applications, with a focus on AI for sequential decision-making and machine learning tasks involving large amounts of missing data. 

During my time at CUNY, I also worked as a research data scientist intern at the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, where I developed machine learning and signal processing pipelines to identify digital biomarkers of sleep and activity in immunological disease populations via wearable activity monitors.

As an undergraduate at Stony Brook University, I majored in applied math & statistics and philosophy, with research focuses on formal methods in metaphilosophy, philosophy of physics, and mathematical logic. My undergraduate research in philosophy was supervised by [Professor Gary Mar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_R._Mar).

## Personal

I am married to my my wife, Amy, who is a breathtakingly-talented fine artist. Check out her work on her [portfolio site](https://www.amyliustudio.com/selected-works) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/amyliustudio/).

Outside of computer science / engineering, I like to run long distances, read literature, sci-fi, and psychological thrillers, and attempt to stay up-to-date with a few branches of contemporary metaphilosophy and philosophy of mind.
