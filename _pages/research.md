The goal of my research is to develop tools and make basic discoveries that inform and facilitate precision health/medicine. Precision medicine may be broadly defined as "the right intervention for the right patient at the right time", and perhaps more specifically as "determining the (potentially multifactorial / copmlex) etiology of an individual's disease(s) / health state, and making some intervention which best addresses that etiology". Given this description, we may consider a broad class of interventions, ranging from pharmacological to surgical to lifestyle changes. My research interests are predominantly focused on conditions in which pharmacological action is most appropriate, but I am interested in the whole spectrum of health science. Here is a list of some research areas I am most interested in:

1. AI-assisted protein engineering and design of targeted drug delivery systems

2. Cell surface proteomic analysis / signal transduction and their heterogeneity across cell types and disease states

3. Continuous health monitoring via wearable biosensors

4. Integration of multi-omic, medical imaging, EHR, and wearable sensor data for personalized disease progression monitoring, disease subtyping, risk scoring, and further clinical decision support

5. Development of machine learning methods that effectively handle imbalanced, high-dimensional, high-missingness datasets

6. Understanding mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases, and designing interventions to combat age-related decline in health

I am still exploring these topics and deciding what to focus on, as there is only so much one can do at a time, but I hope to incorporate each of these threads into my research career long-term.
