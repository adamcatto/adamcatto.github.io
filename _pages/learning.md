# Learning

Given that my research interests are in an area in which I have little formal training, I am designing a curriculum for myself in order to gain a systematic, demonstrable knowledge base in these areas. The courses I am following / designing for myself include topics that I did not study formally as an undergraduate / graduate student, but that are important for biomedical engineering/science.

## Curriculum

* **Electricity and Magnetism**: I did not take a course in electricity and magnetism as an undergraduate; this is clearly one of the most important fundamental courses for engineers/scientists of all sorts, so I am following along the MIT OpenCourseWare course 8.02

* **Molecular and Cell Biology**: I am reading through *Molecular Biology of the Cell* by Alberts et al
